## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in EntglDb, please **DO NOT** open a public issue.

Instead, please report it via privacy-preserving means:
- Email the maintainers directly (if contact info is available).
- Or use GitHub's "Report a vulnerability" feature if enabled.

We will make every effort to acknowledge your report within 48 hours and provide a timeline for a fix.
